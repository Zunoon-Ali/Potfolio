          <p class="intro">
            Hi, I'm <strong> Muhammad Zunoon Ali</strong>, a front-end developer
            based in Karachi with a strong foundation in web development and design. 
            <br />I specialize in crafting responsive, user-centric websites using 
            <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap</strong>, with a keen eye for detail and aesthetics.
          </p>
          <p class="edu">
            My academic journey began at <strong>The Citizen Foundation (TCF)</strong>, 
            where I completed my matriculation with an A grade (77%), focusing on Computer Science. 
            I then pursued my intermediate education at <strong>TCF College Qayyumabad</strong>, earning a 
            <strong>B grade (69%)</strong>, with a specialization in <strong>Pre-Engineering</strong>. 
            Currently, I am enrolled in the <strong>BSCS</strong> program at 
            <strong>SZABIST University</strong>, where I continue to develop my skills in 
            <strong>software development and web technologies</strong>.

          <p class="prevExp">
            Professionally, I completed a one-month internship as a 
            <strong>Laravel developer</strong> at <strong>Fossphorus Software House</strong>,
